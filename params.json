Unfortunately, you commonly have to trust any application you are installing not to do anything nasty. How do you know it won't steal your data, tell on your whereabouts or simply do things you didn't intend (paranoid)? The following list of applications provides alternatives to widely deployed proprietary software that is developed as OpenSource and supported through a community of people not driven by profits.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that the following applications are without issues and bugs. Please use your own best judgement.\r\n\r\n### Trusted Privacy related OpenSource applications\r\n\r\n* freelan [http://www.freelan.org](http://www.freelan.org)\r\n    \r\n    Create your own VPN network.\r\n\r\n* Syncthing [http://syncthing.net](http://syncthing.net)\r\n    \r\n    Awesome direct file syncing between computers.\r\n\r\n* Seafile [http://seafile.com](http://seafile.com)\r\n    \r\n    Run your own data server to store files.\r\n\r\n* OwnCloud [http://owncloud.org](http://owncloud.org)\r\n    \r\n    Run your own cloud server to store anything from files to address books.\r\n\r\n* Baikal [http://baikal-server.com](http://baikal-server.com)\r\n    \r\n    Sync your own personal address book and calendars.\r\n\r\n* GPGtools [https://gpgtools.org](https://gpgtools.org)\r\n    \r\n    Encrypt anything.\r\n\r\n* TextSecure / Signal iOS app [https://github.com/WhisperSystems](https://github.com/WhisperSystems)\r\n    \r\n    Secure and end-to-end encrypted text messaging on Android & iOS.\r\n\r\n### General purpose OpenSource applications\r\n\r\n* Linux [https://github.com/torvalds/linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)\r\n    \r\n    Linux operating system kernel.

These untrusted tools are common proprietary software and probably don't want to do you any harm. However, it is difficult to verify their internals. STAY AWAY from:\r\n\r\n* Dropbox\r\n** If you have to have it: consider using it with [sookasa](http://www.sookasa.com)\r\n* Box\r\n** Same goes here: consider using [boxcryptor](https://www.boxcryptor.com/en)\r\n* Skype\r\n** Microsoft has a track record of analysing Skype communication\r\n* Bittorrent Sync\r\n** Generally alright, but can't compete with OpenSource [syncthing](https://syncthing.net)\r\n* TeamViewer\r\n** I am still looking for good alternatives :(\r\n* WhatsApp\r\n** It's owned by FaceBook\r\n* Microsoft Office\r\n* Microsoft Windows\r\n\r\n\r\n### Recommended hardware\r\nUnfortunately, OpenSource hardware is still difficult to obtain (or build yourself). It is very obviously very difficult (or virtually impossible) to make your own hard-drive for example. Therefore, we have no choice, but to trust large hardware manufacturers. This is not ideal and is probably not going to be changed any time soon. It also provides ability for very hard to detect breaches of trust:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theverge.com/2015/2/16/8048243/nsa-hard-drive-firmware-virus-stuxnet\r\nhttps://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3415904/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.0.pdf\r\n\r\nThere is no other practical solution, but to trust commercially available hardware for most of the components of your computer. However, there are some components which have been developed as an OpenSource platform (such as Adruino). You generally still have to bring your own hard drive (BYOHD), but it is surprising what you can do with these machines already.\r\n\r\n* RaspberryPi 2 B [http://raspberrypi.org](http://raspberrypi.org)\r\n    \r\n    An affordable very basic mini computer for people interested in technology. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nChris\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
